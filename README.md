# Quick Start

## Requirements

- Python 3.5.x

To install the dependencies used in the code, you can use the __requirements.txt__ file as follows -

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Additional Resources

For running the experiments - 
1. Using the SIF Baseline, follow the installation steps given [here](https://github.com/PrincetonML/SIF).
1. For accessing the Bugrepo dataset, download the dataset from this [LogPAI Bugrepo repository.](https://github.com/logpai/bugrepo)

## Running the code

The code is organised as follows. 

```
code/
-----------utils/ # This folder contains all the necessary pre-processing and skeleton code for the models. 
-----------SIF/ # This folder contains the SIF baseline requirements
-----------news_dedup_experiments/ # This folder contains the experiments done with the News Dedup dataset
-----------bugrepo_experiments/ # This folder contains the experiments done with the Bugrepo dataset
```

To run the code for specific experiments, go to their respective Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to train the models. 

For example, to run the code for the TFIDF Experiments for the Bugrepo dataset run the following - 

```
cd bugrepo_experiments/
jupyter notebook
```

and open the ```tf_idf_classification_bugrepo.ipynb``` notebook.
